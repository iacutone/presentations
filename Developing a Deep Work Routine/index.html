      ## Building Our App

      ???
      - Why Elm?
      - Eric's 2017 Show + Tell about Elm & impact (ie, it's why we have Elm in production now)
      - GraphQL (Angelique)
      - Angelique's 2017 Show + Tell about GraphQL
      - OKRs -- require quantifiable results and that wasn't easily accessible for all
      ---

      ### Pro/Con of using Elm
      - Functional programming; errything is data here
      - No run-time errors. Big flashing letters here.
      - Elm nudges your design decisions for data manipulation; this leads to devs resolving so much before the code compiles or is in the browser
      - Amazingly better UX here
      - Question to resolve: Typed & Compiled CSS:  What does it catch/make us aware of vs existing precompilers (SCSS)?
      - Not all "modern" bits are readily available:  packages for better accessibility coverage, no CSS grid in `elm-css`
      - Good to explore this in a small app; not making decisions that affect a whole codebase
      - Parsing JSON (which is what we got back from GH) in a statically typed language is a process; lots of steps; lots of being very specific

      ### Demo

      ## Break It Down

      ???
      - MVP; small incremental goals; what can we get done in 60-90m?
      - Small steps; investigative development process to see what was returned in query, what was displayed by our app
      - Every meeting about achieving a specific goal

      ## Take A Buddy

      ???
      - Get yourself a buddy; helps with accountability and knowledge building; asking questions together; getting at the why (and, admittedly, stumbling around together in the weeds at times)

      ## Commit

      ???
      - Google Calendar == Commitment & public
      - Make it part of _your_ OKRs
