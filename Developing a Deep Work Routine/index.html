      ## Building Our App

      ???
      - Why Elm?
      - Eric's 2017 Show + Tell about Elm & impact (ie, it's why we have Elm in production now)
      - GraphQL (Angelique)
      - Angelique's 2017 Show + Tell about GraphQL
      - OKRs -- require quantifiable results and that wasn't easily accessible for all
      ---

      ### Pros of using Elm
      - Functional programming
        - help think about small functions with _no_ side effects or object mutation

      ### Cons of using Elm
      - Parsing JSON

      ```haskell

      decodeOrganization =
          decode Organization
              |> requiredAt [ "data", "organization", "team", "members", "edges" ] (Json.Decode.list decodeUsers)


      decodeUsers =
          decode Users
              |> required "node" decodeUser

      decodeUser =
          decode User
              |> required "id" string
              |> required "login" string
      ```

      ???
      - parsing data in a statically typed language 

      ---
      ### Parsing the response in Ruby

      ```ruby
        json = JSON.parse(response)
        data = {}
        json['data']['organization']['team']['members']['edges'].each do |node|
          data[node['id']] = node['login']
        end
        data
      ```
      ---

      ### Demo

      [link to app](localhost:8000)

      ???
      - Hosted in a AWS S3 bucket
      - no back end!
      - inspect Network tab on Chrome
      ---

      ## Break It Down

      ???
      - MVP; small incremental goals; what can we get done in 60-90m?
      - Small steps; investigative development process to see what was returned in query, what was displayed by our app
      - Every meeting about achieving a specific goal

      ---

      class: center, middle
      ## Take A Buddy

      ???
      - Get yourself a buddy; helps with accountability and knowledge building; asking questions together; getting at the why (and, admittedly, stumbling around together in the weeds at times)

      ## Commit

      ???
      - Google Calendar == Commitment & public
      - Make it part of _your_ OKRs
