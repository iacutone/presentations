      # Why Elm?
      "The practical result is that Elm code is fast, hard to break,
      easily testable, and profoundly maintainable." -- [Why Elm](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/files/why-elm.pdf)

      # Synopsis

      Functional reactive programming is a declarative approach to GUI design.
      The term declarative makes a distinction between the what and the how
      of programming. A declarative language allows you to say what is displayed,
      without having to specify exactly how the computer should do it.

      To perform these tasks in a traditional GUI framework  such as JavaScript
      would require signicantly more code: manually extracting the mouse
      position from an event and describing exactly how to update the displayed
      value. As a declarative framework, FRP makes this task considerably easier
      by taking care of the how of events, display, and updates.

      # No more FRP

      So is Elm about FRP anymore? No. Those days are over now. Elm is just a functional language that takes concurrency very seriously. And from a user's perspective, Elm is just a friendly functional language! [Source](http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp)
      - Basically, Elm went from using signals (FRP) to commands and subscriptions

      # Cons

      --
      * Takes a while to get used to the type system

      --
      * Takes a while to get used to the syntax

      --
      * Wrapping your head around things like generating a random number
      ---
      # Pros
